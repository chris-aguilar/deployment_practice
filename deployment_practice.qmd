## Intro

This is practice for Github pages deployments. The goal is to create a working web page, break the deployment through pushing commits, and subsequently fix it without deleting the repo.

## Working version

### Original push
This is some text. Below is code that works.

This is a good stopping point. I'll add and commit this. 

```{r}
plot(faithful)
```

## Update to web page

This section is added after the first working deployment. I'll save this, render again, add everything, and commit. I expect the deployment to stop working once I do this.

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```
